    "text": "About\nThis script covers the computational and bioinformatics parts of the module “Methods in Evolutionary Ecology”. We will introduce you to R and BASH, two of the most widely used scripting languages, and make you familiar with navigating in a UNIX environment. These skills are important for any biologist, irrespective of the field you may want to specialise in in the future. Building upon your new knowledge, we will learn how to reconstruct phylogenies from sequencing data, how to work with genomic data, and how to characterise microbiomes. At the end of three weeks computational work, you will tackle a small computational group project, putting your new skills into practise.\nThe script is designed to cover the entire course content. While we will go you through all of the material together in detail during the course, the script should also enable you to work through the content on your own, e.g., to recap after the course has finished and as a reference and starting point for future computational endeavours.",

    "text": "Quarto\nThe text is formatted using Quarto, which comes with a number of benefits. It allows us to provide explanations as structured and nicely formatted regular text, and to include code blocks for all computational steps. When compiling Quarto documents, all of the code is run, which means that you not only see the code, but also the outputs it creates.\nHere is an example:\nThis little block of R code generates 100 random coordinates and plots them. The code is shown below, together with the output the code has produced (in this case, a plot).\n\nx &lt;- runif(100)\ny &lt;- runif(100)\nplot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code can conveniently be copied from the block into your own scripts.\nQuarto supports many formats, we here provide the script as a webpage and a printable pdf. Writing Quarto documents is very simple and can be done using RStudio as an editor. The entire script is available for you on github – feel free to download it and modify it with your own comments, notes, and code. We will provide a short introduction to github and Quarto in the course.",

    "text": "1.1 Operators and functions\nR is a statistical programming environment that has become a standard tool in the data and life sciences and many other fields. You may have used R already to run some statistics in a course you took in your studies, and this will be a likely use case for your remaining degree. However, R is much more: it can be used to analyse massive the datasets of the “omics”- age, build webpages, blogs, and interactive apps, and even for art!\nBefore taking full advantage of what the various R packages have to offer, we need to become familiar with its basic structure and commands. It pays off to invest a little effort in practicing the basics, because all R packages use the same syntax – a solid familiarity with base R thus allows you to explore the entire R universe independently.\nR can be used just like an arithmetic calculator. You are familiar with all of the basic syntax already, if you know how to use a calculator!\nSome examples:\n3 + 4  \n\n[1] 7\n\n3 - 4  \n\n[1] -1\n\n3 * 4  \n\n[1] 12\n\n3 / 4  \n\n[1] 0.75\n\n3 ^ 4  # power of\n\n[1] 81\nAs with a regular calculator, there is operator precedence: power &gt; multiplicative operations &gt; additive operations:\n(1 + 2) * 3\n\n[1] 9\n\n2^3 * 3\n\n[1] 24\n\n2^(3 * 3)\n\n[1] 512\nSquare roots, exponentials, and logarithms also work just as with a calculator:\nsqrt(9) \n\n[1] 3\n\nexp(3) \n\n[1] 20.08554\n\nlog(3) \n\n[1] 1.098612\n\nlog(exp(3)) # natural logarithm\n\n[1] 3\n\nlog10(100)  # logarithm to base 10\n\n[1] 2\nIn order to “save” a value for use later on, you have to assign it to a variable! &lt;- is the assignment operator you need to use for this (handy shortcut in RStudio is ALT + -).\nx &lt;- 3 + 4\nCalling the variable will then print the result to the R console, and can be used in other calculations.\nx\n\n[1] 7\n\nx + 10\n\n[1] 17\nYou can call your variables whatever you want, but be careful: R will overwrite any variable if you tell it to, without a warning! You should also avoid giving your variables names that are already assigned to functions.\nmy_favourite_variable &lt;- 100\nmy_favourite_variable &lt;- 50\nmy_favourite_variable\n\n[1] 50\nAll variables (among other things) are visible in the environment panel in RStudio (default: top right part of the screen).",

    "text": "2.1 Vectors\nSo far we’ve only looked at simple variables consisting of a single value or character. Typically, your data will be more complex. In R, there are three structures relevant for the data you will be working with.\nA vector is a number of elements of the same data type (logical, numeric, character). It can be generated by concatenating the elements using the function c.\nvec1 &lt;- c(T, F, T, F)\nvec1\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\nmode(vec1)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\nvec2 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nvec2\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nmode(vec2)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nvec3 &lt;- c(\"Spring\", \"Summer\", \"Autumn\", \"Winter\")\nvec3\n\n[1] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\n\nmode(vec3)\n\n[1] \"character\"\nOther ways to generate vectors are rep and seq. rep is used to repeat any number of elements any number of times.\nrep(5, 10)\n\n [1] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nrep(vec3, 5)\n\n [1] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\" \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\n [9] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\" \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\n[17] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\nseq can be used to create numerical sequences.\nseq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5)\n\n [1]   0   5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90\n[20]  95 100\nThe command above is easy to read and understand for humans, which is good.

Combining multiple different data types may result in some unwanted behaviour.\nvec_mix1 &lt;- c(5, TRUE, 65)\nmode(vec_mix1)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nvec_mix2 &lt;- c(\"blue\", TRUE, \"red\")\nmode(vec_mix2)\n\n[1] \"character\"\nIn many cases you may wish to access a single element of a vector. You can do so using square brackets.\nz &lt;- c(\"order\", \"family\", \"genus\", \"species\")\nz[2]\n\n[1] \"family\"\nSimilarly, you can access any combination of elements from the vector.\nz[1:2]\n\n[1] \"order\"  \"family\"\n\ni &lt;- c(1, 3)\nz[i]\n\n[1] \"order\" \"genus\"\n\nz[c(1, 1, 1, 4)]\n\n[1] \"order\"   \"order\"   \"order\"   \"species\"\n\nz[-1]\n\n[1] \"family\"  \"genus\"   \"species\"\nThe square brackets are also used if you need to change elements of the vector. Changes are made using the assignment operator which you already know.\nx &lt;- 1:5\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nx[c(1, 4)] &lt;- 10\nx\n\n[1] 10  2  3 10  5\nWhich elements of a vector have certain characteristics? This is important for filtering/selecting in your dataset. You can combine different queries using logical operators.\nx &gt;= 5\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\nx[x &gt;= 5]\n\n[1] 10 10  5\n\nwhich(x &gt;= 5)\n\n[1] 1 4 5\n\nz\n\n[1] \"order\"   \"family\"  \"genus\"   \"species\"\n\nwhich(z == \"genus\")\n\n[1] 3\n\nz[z== \"genus\"]\n\n[1] \"genus\"\n\nz[z != \"genus\"]\n\n[1] \"order\"   \"family\"  \"species\"\n\nwhich(z== \"genus\" | z == \"order\")\n\n[1] 1 3\nLogical operators in R\nConveniently, the elements of a vector can be named and accessed using the names.

Lots of the functionality of R is in external packages which need to be installed manually. The majority of relevant packages are found on CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network), and there is a special archive for packages relevant to the life sciences (Bioconductor). In order to install packages from CRAN, simply run\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", dependencies = TRUE)\nHere, tidyverse is the package we want to install we ask to also install any packages that tidyverse may require to function. You can find a list of all packages currently installed in the packages tab in the panel on the bottom left in RStudio. It is good practise to keep the packages, as well as your R installation up to date.",

    "text": "3.2 Functions\nWe have already used plenty of functions. Most of them require at least an object an which to perform the function on, and may also have some options. For example, consider the following function:\n\nmean(be$range.size, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 261.4116\n\n\nmean is the function, be$range.size is the object (1 vector from the dataframe we just read into R) and na.rm = TRUE is the option to remove NAs from the vector before calculating the mean.\nIn some cases, you may want to do things to your data that cannot be addressed by a single function. In this case, you may have to perform a number of different operations on the dataset. If you are likely to use the same set of operations in the future, it may be advisable to use your own functions.\nA very simple example. Let’s assume the mean function didn’t exist and we would need to write our own.\n\nmean2 &lt;- function(x){\n  x &lt;- na.omit(x)\n  sum(x) / length(x) \n}\n\nmean2(be$range.size)\n\n[1] 261.4116\n\n\nWe define mean2 as a function that requires an object (here called x as an input). Looking into the function, we can see that it first removes the NAs from the object and next calculates the sum of x divided by the number of elements of x (this is how the mean is defined). Testing it, we can see that it gives the same result as the native mean function.",

filtering criterion can be specified using the methods you are already familiar with (e.g., &gt;, &gt;=, !=, %in%).\nNotice that the variable names can be used directly here, so instead of using be$OWS_egg, filter() lets you use OWS_egg directly.

Also, trying out many different filters to see what they do with the data can be cumbersome. This where %&gt;% comes in really handy.\nThe “pipe” %&gt;% (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+M) simply passes the result of one function to the next function.

    "text": "4.9 group_by() and summarise() as powerful data exploration tools\nAlthough dplyr has a simpler syntax overall, everything we have looked at so far could have been done fairly easily with base R functions: data frame filtering, sorting, and adding and removing columns. One of the strengths of dplyr is explorative data analysis, and this is where group_by() and summarize() are really helpful. We’ll only look at very simple examples today.\nWhen browsing through the complete data table, it is very hard to recognize any patterns. Let’s assume we wanted to compare the average wing span of butterflies with that overwinter as adults vs all other butterflies:\n\n# Are butterflies that overwinter as adults larger than other species?\nbe %&gt;% \n  drop_na() %&gt;% \n  group_by(OWS_adult) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_wsp = mean(WSP_Female_average))\n\n\n\n\n\nOWS_adult\nmean_wsp\n\n\n\n\n0\n39.42489\n\n\n1\n51.85294\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter choosing which variable to group by (here: OWS_adult), summarise() then calculates a function for each group. In our simple example, there are 2 groups: 0 (not overwintering as adult) and 1 (overwintering as adult); and the function to be calculated is the mean of the female wing span. This is a very flexible set of functions, because you can group by multiple groups and also use summarise() with many different functions (e.g., mean(), sum(), min(), max(), median() – just to name a few). Let’s look at a more complex example:\n\n# Let's add another group. How large is the standard deviation? How large is each group?\nbe %&gt;% \n  drop_na() %&gt;% \n  group_by(OWS_adult, LEV_ground_layer) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_wsp = mean(WSP_Female_average),\n            sd = sd(WSP_Female_average),\n            group_size=n())\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'OWS_adult'.

There are many additional themes available through packages such as ggthemr or ggthemes.\nA bit more on aesthetics: have you noticed that you only specify x and y once, and all geoms know what you want to plot. You can also specify additional aesthetics for each geom.\n\n# Add additional aesthetics, here: we want to plot the sonservation status. How?
