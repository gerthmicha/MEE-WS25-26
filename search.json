    "text": "About\nThis script covers the computational and bioinformatics parts of the module “Methods in Evolutionary Ecology”. We will introduce you to R and BASH, two of the most widely used scripting languages, and make you familiar with navigating in a UNIX environment. These skills are important for any biologist, irrespective of the field you may want to specialise in in the future. Building upon your new knowledge, we will learn how to reconstruct phylogenies from sequencing data, how to work with genomic data, and how to characterise microbiomes. At the end of three weeks computational work, you will tackle a small computational group project, putting your new skills into practise.\nThe script is designed to cover the entire course content. While we will go you through all of the material together in detail during the course, the script should also enable you to work through the content on your own, e.g., to recap after the course has finished and as a reference and starting point for future computational endeavours.",

    "text": "Quarto\nThe text is formatted using Quarto, which comes with a number of benefits. It allows us to provide explanations as structured and nicely formatted regular text, and to include code blocks for all computational steps. When compiling Quarto documents, all of the code is run, which means that you not only see the code, but also the outputs it creates.\nHere is an example:\nThis little block of R code generates 100 random coordinates and plots them. The code is shown below, together with the output the code has produced (in this case, a plot).\n\nx &lt;- runif(100)\ny &lt;- runif(100)\nplot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code can conveniently be copied from the block into your own scripts.\nQuarto supports many formats, we here provide the script as a webpage and a printable pdf. Writing Quarto documents is very simple and can be done using RStudio as an editor. The entire script is available for you on github – feel free to download it and modify it with your own comments, notes, and code. We will provide a short introduction to github and Quarto in the course.",

    "text": "1.1 Operators and functions\nR is a statistical programming environment that has become a standard tool in the data and life sciences and many other fields. You may have used R already to run some statistics in a course you took in your studies, and this will be a likely use case for your remaining degree. However, R is much more: it can be used to analyse massive the datasets of the “omics”- age, build webpages, blogs, and interactive apps, and even for art!\nBefore taking full advantage of what the various R packages have to offer, we need to become familiar with its basic structure and commands. It pays off to invest a little effort in practicing the basics, because all R packages use the same syntax – a solid familiarity with base R thus allows you to explore the entire R universe independently.\nR can be used just like an arithmetic calculator. You are familiar with all of the basic syntax already, if you know how to use a calculator!\nSome examples:\n3 + 4  \n\n[1] 7\n\n3 - 4  \n\n[1] -1\n\n3 * 4  \n\n[1] 12\n\n3 / 4  \n\n[1] 0.75\n\n3 ^ 4  # power of\n\n[1] 81\nAs with a regular calculator, there is operator precedence: power &gt; multiplicative operations &gt; additive operations:\n(1 + 2) * 3\n\n[1] 9\n\n2^3 * 3\n\n[1] 24\n\n2^(3 * 3)\n\n[1] 512\nSquare roots, exponentials, and logarithms also work just as with a calculator:\nsqrt(9) \n\n[1] 3\n\nexp(3) \n\n[1] 20.08554\n\nlog(3) \n\n[1] 1.098612\n\nlog(exp(3)) # natural logarithm\n\n[1] 3\n\nlog10(100)  # logarithm to base 10\n\n[1] 2\nIn order to “save” a value for use later on, you have to assign it to a variable! &lt;- is the assignment operator you need to use for this (handy shortcut in RStudio is ALT + -).\nx &lt;- 3 + 4\nCalling the variable will then print the result to the R console, and can be used in other calculations.\nx\n\n[1] 7\n\nx + 10\n\n[1] 17\nYou can call your variables whatever you want, but be careful: R will overwrite any variable if you tell it to, without a warning! You should also avoid giving your variables names that are already assigned to functions.\nmy_favourite_variable &lt;- 100\nmy_favourite_variable &lt;- 50\nmy_favourite_variable\n\n[1] 50\nAll variables (among other things) are visible in the environment panel in RStudio (default: top right part of the screen).",

    "text": "2.1 Vectors\nSo far we’ve only looked at simple variables consisting of a single value or character. Typically, your data will be more complex. In R, there are three structures relevant for the data you will be working with.\nA vector is a number of elements of the same data type (logical, numeric, character). It can be generated by concatenating the elements using the function c.\nvec1 &lt;- c(T, F, T, F)\nvec1\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\nmode(vec1)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\nvec2 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nvec2\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nmode(vec2)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nvec3 &lt;- c(\"Spring\", \"Summer\", \"Autumn\", \"Winter\")\nvec3\n\n[1] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\n\nmode(vec3)\n\n[1] \"character\"\nOther ways to generate vectors are rep and seq. rep is used to repeat any number of elements any number of times.\nrep(5, 10)\n\n [1] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nrep(vec3, 5)\n\n [1] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\" \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\n [9] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\" \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\n[17] \"Spring\" \"Summer\" \"Autumn\" \"Winter\"\nseq can be used to create numerical sequences.\nseq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5)\n\n [1]   0   5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90\n[20]  95 100\nThe command above is easy to read and understand for humans, which is good.

Combining multiple different data types may result in some unwanted behaviour.\nvec_mix1 &lt;- c(5, TRUE, 65)\nmode(vec_mix1)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nvec_mix2 &lt;- c(\"blue\", TRUE, \"red\")\nmode(vec_mix2)\n\n[1] \"character\"\nIn many cases you may wish to access a single element of a vector. You can do so using square brackets.\nz &lt;- c(\"order\", \"family\", \"genus\", \"species\")\nz[2]\n\n[1] \"family\"\nSimilarly, you can access any combination of elements from the vector.\nz[1:2]\n\n[1] \"order\"  \"family\"\n\ni &lt;- c(1, 3)\nz[i]\n\n[1] \"order\" \"genus\"\n\nz[c(1, 1, 1, 4)]\n\n[1] \"order\"   \"order\"   \"order\"   \"species\"\n\nz[-1]\n\n[1] \"family\"  \"genus\"   \"species\"\nThe square brackets are also used if you need to change elements of the vector. Changes are made using the assignment operator which you already know.\nx &lt;- 1:5\nx\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nx[c(1, 4)] &lt;- 10\nx\n\n[1] 10  2  3 10  5\nWhich elements of a vector have certain characteristics? This is important for filtering/selecting in your dataset. You can combine different queries using logical operators.\nx &gt;= 5\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\nx[x &gt;= 5]\n\n[1] 10 10  5\n\nwhich(x &gt;= 5)\n\n[1] 1 4 5\n\nz\n\n[1] \"order\"   \"family\"  \"genus\"   \"species\"\n\nwhich(z == \"genus\")\n\n[1] 3\n\nz[z== \"genus\"]\n\n[1] \"genus\"\n\nz[z != \"genus\"]\n\n[1] \"order\"   \"family\"  \"species\"\n\nwhich(z== \"genus\" | z == \"order\")\n\n[1] 1 3\nLogical operators in R\nConveniently, the elements of a vector can be named and accessed using the names.

Lots of the functionality of R is in external packages which need to be installed manually. The majority of relevant packages are found on CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network), and there is a special archive for packages relevant to the life sciences (Bioconductor). In order to install packages from CRAN, simply run\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", dependencies = TRUE)\nHere, tidyverse is the package we want to install we ask to also install any packages that tidyverse may require to function. You can find a list of all packages currently installed in the packages tab in the panel on the bottom left in RStudio. It is good practise to keep the packages, as well as your R installation up to date.",

For example, consider the following function:\n\nmean(be$range.size, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 261.4116\n\n\nmean is the function, be$range.size is the object (1 vector from the dataframe we just read into R) and na.rm = TRUE is the option to remove NAs from the vector before calculating the mean.\nIn some cases, you may want to do things to your data that cannot be addressed by a single function. In this case, you may have to perform a number of different operations on the dataset. If you are likely to use the same set of operations in the future, it may be advisable to use your own functions.\nA very simple example. Let’s assume the mean function didn’t exist and we would need to write our own.\n\nmean2 &lt;- function(x){\n  x &lt;- na.omit(x)\n  sum(x) / length(x) \n}\n\nmean2(be$range.size)\n\n[1] 261.4116\n\n\nWe define mean2 as a function that requires an object (here called x as an input). Looking into the function, we can see that it first removes the NAs from the object and next calculates the sum of x divided by the number of elements of x (this is how the mean is defined). Testing it, we can see that it gives the same result as the native mean function.",

All tidyverse functions work like that. Let’s look at more complex filtering:\n\n# combine 2 filters with boolean \"AND\" ...\nfilter(be, OWS_egg == 1 , ALT_Min &gt; 500)\n\n\n  \n\n\n# ... or boolean \"OR\"\nfilter(be, OWS_egg == 1 | AFB_honeydew == 1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nNOTE\nfilter() (and many other tidyverse functions) return a data frame.

Also, trying out many different filters to see what they do with the data can be cumbersome. This where %&gt;% comes in really handy.\nThe “pipe” %&gt;% (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+M) simply passes the result of one function to the next function. For the next function, one does not have to specify the data frame. Let’s see an example.\n\n# this is how we filtered our data frame earlier \nfilter(be, OWS_egg == 1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n# same command, this time using the pipe\nbe %&gt;% \n  filter(OWS_egg == 1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNote how in the second command, the output of be (which is our data frame) gets passed on to the filter() command. There, you don’t have to specify the name of the data frame again. The result of this can be piped further to other commands:\n\n# Multiple filters are connected by pipes\nbe %&gt;% \n  filter(OWS_egg == 1) %&gt;% \n  filter(LEV_ground_layer == 1) %&gt;% \n  filter(AFB_honeydew == 1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n# As always in R, assign the result to a new variable using \"&lt;-\" \nbe_filtered &lt;- be %&gt;% \n  filter(OWS_egg == 1) %&gt;% \n  filter(LEV_ground_layer == 1) %&gt;% \n  filter(AFB_honeydew == 1)\n\nNote how easy this command is to read (you could write it in a single line, but it’s much easier to follow with line breaks)! The usefulness of the pipe will become more obvious when we combine multiple different commands. In all the following examples, I will always use the pipe.",

One of the strengths of dplyr is explorative data analysis, and this is where group_by() and summarize() are really helpful. We’ll only look at very simple examples today.\nWhen browsing through the complete data table, it is very hard to recognize any patterns. Let’s assume we wanted to compare the average wing span of butterflies with that overwinter as adults vs all other butterflies:\n\n# Are butterflies that overwinter as adults larger than other species?\nbe %&gt;% \n  drop_na() %&gt;% \n  group_by(OWS_adult) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_wsp = mean(WSP_Female_average))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAfter choosing which variable to group by (here: OWS_adult), summarise() then calculates a function for each group. In our simple example, there are 2 groups: 0 (not overwintering as adult) and 1 (overwintering as adult); and the function to be calculated is the mean of the female wing span. This is a very flexible set of functions, because you can group by multiple groups and also use summarise() with many different functions (e.g., mean(), sum(), min(), max(), median() – just to name a few). Let’s look at a more complex example:\n\n# Let's add another group. How large is the standard deviation? How large is each group?\nbe %&gt;% \n  drop_na() %&gt;% \n  group_by(OWS_adult, LEV_ground_layer) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_wsp = mean(WSP_Female_average),\n            sd = sd(WSP_Female_average),\n            group_size=n())\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'OWS_adult'.

There are different shells available e.g bash, zsh, sh, csh etc. Each of them offering unique features and functionalities.

    "text": "6.4 Some important rules\n\nBe aware of the case! The command line is case sensitive so be careful when typing. For example, typing Echo is not the same as echo, nor are the directory names “/Results” and “/results”.\nSpaces are having special use! The command line uses spaces as separators between arguments. Using spaces in filenames or directory names will certainly cause problems sooner or later. Avoid using names that contain spaces, but rather it’s better to use dashes (-) or underscores (_). e.g., “results_2026.txt” is preferred over “results 2026.txt”.\nApart from spaces there are several other characters (special characters) that can be used to perform special operations. See some examples bellow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n/\nDirectory separator, used to separate a string of directory names. Example: /usr/src/linux\n\n\n\\\nEscape — (backslash) prevents the next character from being interpreted as a special character. This works outside of quoting, inside double quotes, and generally ignored in single quotes.\n\n\n.\nCurrent directory. Can also “hide” files when it is the first character in a filename.\n\n\n..\nParent directory\n\n\n~\nThe tilde is a representation of the current user’s home directory.\n\n\n*\nRepresents 0 or more characters in a filename, or by itself, all files in a directory.\n\n\n?\nRepresents a single character in a filename.\n\n\n$\nExpansion — introduces various types of expansion: parameter expansion (e.g. $var or ${var}), command substitution (e.g. $(command)), or arithmetic expansion (e.g. $((expression))). More on expansions later.\n\n\n[ ]\nCan be used to represent a range of values, e.g. [0-9], [A-Z], etc. Example: hello[0-2].txt represents the names hello0.txt, hello1.txt, and hello2.txt\n\n\n|\nPipe — send the output from one command to the input of another command. This is a method of chaining commands together. Example: echo “Hello beautiful.” | grep -o beautiful.\n\n\n&gt;\nRedirect output of a command into a new file. If the file already exists, over-write it. Example: ls &gt; myfiles.txt\n\n\n&gt;&gt;\nRedirect and appends the output of a command onto the end of an existing file.\n\n\n&lt;\nRedirect a file as input to a program.\n\n\n;\nCommand separator. Allows you to execute multiple commands on a single line. Example: cd /var/log ; ls -l\n\n\n&&\nCommand separator as above, but only runs the second command if the first one finished without errors.\n\n\n&\nBackground – when used at the end of a command, run the command in the background (do not wait for it to complete).\n\n\n#\nComment — the # character begins a commentary that extends to the end of the line. Comments are notes of explanation and are not processed by the shell.",

In the UNIX file-system each file and directory has its own “address”, and that address is called a “path”.\nThere are two special locations in all Unix-based systems That you should be familiar. The “root” location is where the address system of the computer starts. The “home” location is where the current user’s location starts.\nBy default every time you open a new terminal you start in your own “home” directory(containing files and directories that only you can modify). The path of home directory is usually represented by the “~” character.\nBasic commands we will use\nThe pwd command in Linux is short for print working directory. It’s only function is to print the absolute path of the current directory. It’s handy when you’re not exactly sure what directory you’re in.

    "text": "9.1 Redirecting and piping\nRedirection and piping are fundamental features of the UNIX command line that allow us to create powerful workflows for automating tasks. By default, when we run a command, its output is printed to the screen (the terminal). In many situations, however, we may want to save this output to a file or pass it directly to another command.\nWe have already seen how a command output can be redirected to a file. For example: cat file1 file2 &gt; combined_file. In this command, the redirection operator &gt; tells the shell to send the output of cat to a new file called combined_file instead of displaying it on the screen. Let look at another example.\nWhile redirection allows us to save a command’s output to a file, UNIX also allows us to connect commands directly to one another. We can send the output of one command directly as input to another using the pipe (|) operator.\nExercise",

    "text": "9.2 cut, sort, and uniq\nThe cut command is used for extracting specific sections from lines of text in a file or piped data. It’s a great tools for or data manipulation. Lets try some examples:\n# Selecting fields separated by a delimiter\necho \"name,age,city,country\" | cut -d ',' -f 3\n# lets manipulate some real data\ncat butterfly_ecology.csv | cut -d ',' -f 1,2 | head\n# you can even change the delimiter in the output\ncat butterfly_ecology.csv | cut -d ',' -f 1,2  --output-delimiter $'\\t' | head\n# or\ncat butterfly_ecology.csv | cut -d ',' -f 1,2,5-7  --output-delimiter $'\\t' | head\nThe sort command is used to arrange the lines of text files in a specified order, such as alphabetically or numerically. It can also handle options for sorting in reverse order or by specific columns. NOTE: sort command will not modify your file, it will only print the reordered content on the terminal! However, you can specify redirect the output to a separate file.\ncat butterfly_ecology.csv | cut -d ',' -f 1-3 | sort\ncat butterfly_ecology.csv | cut -d ',' -f 1-3 | sort -t ',' -k3 | less\nThe uniq command in Linux is used to filter out repeated lines from a text file or standard input, displaying only unique entries or counting repetitions. It works best when the input is sorted, as it only removes adjacent duplicate lines.\n# families are represented in the butterfly_ecology.csv data?\ncat butterfly_ecology.csv | cut -d ',' -f 2 | sort | uniq\nExercise\n\nCan you use cut, sort and uniq commands to count the number of species per family species per family?",

    "text": "9.3 grep and regular expressions\nThegrep (global regular expression) command in Linux is used to search for specific patterns or strings within files and display the matching lines. It is a powerful tool for text processing and can be customized with various options to refine search results. The basic usage is: grep “searchword” filename\n# Let's say you wished to identify every line which contain the string \"Papilionidae\" from the butterfly_ecology.csv\ngrep 'Papilionidae' butterfly_ecology.csv\n# We can find the number of lines that matches the given string/pattern instead\ngrep -c 'Papilionidae' butterfly_ecology.csv\n# Use -f  option to read patterns from a file\ncat &gt; family.txt\nPapilionidae\nHesperiidae\n# exit by pressing Ctrl + D\ngrep -f family.txt butterfly_ecology.csv\n# We can search for patterns in multiple files (e.g. all the files in the directory)\ngrep 'Papilionidae' *\ngrep command is particularly powerful when used in combination with Regular Expressions. A regular expression (regex) in Linux is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, similar to the wildcards, and are commonly used for searching and manipulating text.\nExercises\n\nIn the butterfly_ecology.csv file find all “Aglais” species and save the fields species, family, range.size in a new file.\nThe shell keeps a record of the commands you have previously run. You can display this list using the history command. Using this information, determine how many times you have used the ls command in your shell history. Hint: You may need to combine history with other command-line tools such as grep.",
