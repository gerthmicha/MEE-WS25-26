Unix systems, like most operating systems, store file locations in a hierarchical structure. In the UNIX file-system each file and directory has its own “address”, and that address is called a “**path**”.

There are two special locations in all Unix-based systems That you should be familiar. The “**root**” location is where the address system of the computer starts. The “**home**” location is where the current user’s location starts.

By default every time you open a new terminal you start in your own “**home**” directory(containing files and directories that only you can modify). The path of home directory is usually represented by the "\~" character.

**Basic commands we will use**

| Command  | Description             |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `pwd`    | print working directory |
| `ls`     | list items in directory |
| `cd`     | change directory        |
| `cd ..`  | go one level up         |
| `ls -l`  | long format listing     |
| `ls -lh` | human readable sizes    |

## Finding out where you are

The `pwd` command in Linux is short for ***p**rint* ***w**orking* ***d**irectory*. It’s only function is to print the absolute path of the current directory. It's handy when you’re not exactly sure what directory you’re in. So make it a good habit to get used to running the **`pwd`** command a lot.

``` bash
# Example. Try running pwd. What do you see?
pwd
# What do you see if you run PWD instead? 
PWD
# Try now to run this "echo $PWD". The command echo just prints the parameters we give it. The $PWD is a environment variable and we will discuss about their use a bit later on.
echo $PWD
```

## The command `ls`

**`ls`** is short for *list*, and is used to list the files and sub-directories in your present working directory or some other directory if you specify one.

``` bash
# Examples
# List the files and directories in your current directory
ls
# or
ls .
# ls can accept several options. Try running the following commands and observe how their output differs from the previous one.
ls -l
# or
ls -lh
# You can use ls to list the contents of any directory. Try the following.
ls -l /etc 
```

## Note

**I. The anatomy of a command (or command syntax)**

Each command is usually composed of three parts:

1.  **The command** itself

2.  **The options:** These are optional parameters that can be used to customise the behavior of a command. (e.g. on the previous examples `ls -l` shows the list of files in a long format)

3.  **The arguments:** specify the target of the command. (e.g. on the previous example `ls -l /etc` you instructed the command to list the contents of the **/etc** directory)

**II. Getting help**

Most Unix commands can accept several parameters. How do we know which ones to use and why? Luckily, most Unix commands have built-in help documentation that we can access by providing *--help* as the only argument.

Try for example: `ls --help`

Another way to access the documentation for a command is by using the `man` command and providing the command’s name as an argument. For example:

`man ls`
:::

## Relative vs absolute path and getting help

There are two ways to specify the path (the file’s address on the computer):

-   An **absolute path** starts from a fixed location, either the root directory (/) or the home directory (\~/). Note: A “full path” usually refers to an absolute path that starts from the root (/).
-   A **relative path** starts from your current directory.

> When working at the command line, it’s important to always be aware of your current location in the system. One of the most common mistakes is trying to operate on a file that isn’t where you think it is. To avoid this, it’s good practice to use absolute paths, which clearly specify a file’s exact location regardless of where you are.

## Moving around

One of the most commonly used commands in Linux is the ***change directory*** command, or `cd`. It allows you to change your working directory from the current location to another directory you want to navigate to. The `cd` command takes a positional argument: the path (address) of the directory you want to move into. This path can be either **absolute** or **relative**. Let’s try moving from our current directory to a directory present in your home directory called *Documents*.

``` bash
# The relative way
cd Documents
# The absolute way (~ stands for /home/<user>/). Can you see the change in your command prompt?
cd ~/Documents
# But how do we go back “up” to the parent directory? We can use the ".." special characters that act as a relative path, telling the system to move up one directory from our current location.
cd ..
# When you need to navigate back to the previous working directory from the current working directory, you can use the "–" option.
cd -
# Note: running the cd command without any arguments will always bring you back to your home
cd
```

## Exercise

Practice moving around the filesystem with `cd` and listing directory contents with `ls`, including navigating by relative and absolute paths or using special characters ".." . Use `pwd` frequently to see your current working directory. Practice navigating home with `cd`.
